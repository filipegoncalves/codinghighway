3.7.7
Typical dictionaries allow one to look up the definition of a word, and Problem 2.1 describes a dictionary that allows one to look up the anagrams of a word. Design dictionaries for looking up the proper spelling of a word and
for looking up the rhymes of a word. Discuss dictionaries for looking up an integer sequence (such as 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...), a chemical structure, or the metrical structure of a song.

This exercise is about signatures. A dictionary is defined by sorting a word according to a signature function. So, basically this exercise is about finding a good signature for each of the kind of dictionaries.
Looking up the proper spelling of a word is the most common use of a words dictionary. Hence, the signature is the identity function, meaning, a word's signature is itself. Sorting alphabetically will allow anyone to
sequentially look up (or even using binary search) the proper spelling of any word, provided they know how to write at least part of the beginning of the word.
Rhymes are a little different; two words rhyme if they are terminated with the same letters. It can be a little hard to define how many letters from right to left are required to match up between two words to consider them a
rhyme, but the generic idea is that a good signature would be the reverse of a word, because sorting would place words that end up with the same letters next to each other.
Every dictionary exercise is about choosing the right signature. Integer sequences can be stored with an identity signature as well, so that sorting them alphabetically makes it easy to find a particular sequence.
